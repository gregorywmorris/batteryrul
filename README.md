# 1. Entity: DataIngestionConfig

    What it is: This is a data class that defines the structure for data ingestion configuration. It acts like a blueprint for how the ingestion process will be set up.

    What it does: It holds configuration details required for data ingestion, such as the root directory, MongoDB URI, database name, and collection name.

    Input: Configuration details read from a YAML configuration file.

    Output: An instance of DataIngestionConfig with the specified configuration details.


# 2. Configuration: ConfigurationManager

What it is: A class that manages configurations by reading them from YAML files.

    What it does:
        - Reads configuration, parameters, and schema details from YAML files.
        - Creates necessary directories specified in the configuration.
        - Provides a method to get the data ingestion configuration as an instance of DataIngestionConfig.

    Input: Paths to configuration, parameters, and schema YAML files.
        - config_filepath: The path to the YAML file containing the general project configuration.
        - params_filepath: The path to the YAML file containing the parameters for the data ingestion process.
        - schema_filepath: The path to the YAML file defining the schema for the data.

    Output: Configuration details and a method to get the data ingestion configuration (get_data_ingestion_config)

    Usage: You'd instantiate ConfigurationManager to load your YAML files and then call get_data_ingestion_config to obtain the specific configuration for data ingestion.

#  Data Ingestion: DataIngestion

    What it is: A class responsible for the actual data ingestion process. Fetching data from a MongoDB database and saving it to a CSV file.

    What it does: Connects to MongoDB, fetches data from a specified collection, converts it to a DataFrame, and saves it as a CSV file.

    Input: An instance of DataIngestionConfig containing the necessary configuration details.
        - A DataFrame containing the data from MongoDB (potentially written to a CSV file)

    Output: A CSV file containing the data fetched from MongoDB.

    Usage: You'd create an instance of DataIngestion, passing in the data_ingestion_config obtained from ConfigurationManager. Then, you would call import_data_from_mongodb to perform the ingestion task.


# Pipeline 

``
What it is: The main execution block of the script. The data ingestion process when the script is run directly

What it does:
    - Initializes the configuration manager.
    - Retrieves the data ingestion configuration.
    - Creates an instance of DataIngestion with the configuration (data_ingestion_config).
    - Invokes the data ingestion process to fetch data from MongoDB.

Input: None directly, but it uses the configuration files and the classes defined above.

Output: Executes the data ingestion process and logs the completion status. The imported data from MongoDB (possibly saved to a CSV file).
